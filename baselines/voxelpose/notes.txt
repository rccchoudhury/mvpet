to debug:

1. Why does the GPU inference only work in jupyter? GPU visibility?
    - madge accidentally deleted the test_train thing. 
2. Can't run the model unless a validation script is run on it? Must be since the 
model isn't loaded onto the GPU properly?


to do: 
0. Already have the metrics 
1. create visuzliatsion for voxelpose on campus/shelf
    ok videos don't really make sense atm sadge
    idaelly: large 3D viz and overlay ontop fo the joints.
2. run mvpose
3. adapt geometric (?) to campus./shelf
